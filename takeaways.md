- Solved the first 5 problems, they were pretty straightforward. 

- Use printf/scanf or `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` and `cin.tie(null);`

- Use long long int! As long as it fits the memory limits

- scanf returns int, compiler will warn about it. Use other methods like a fixed buffer or cast into (void) and do nothing

- The spiral one was interesting, it boils down to implementing the rules in 4 cases, x>=y or not, one even or not
